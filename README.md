#Wu Tang Challenge

Given the dataset located in ``data.json``, please construct a page in ``index.php`` displaying a table of Wu members ordered from oldest to youngest.

##Requirements

1. ``data.json`` may not be physically manipulated in any way.
2. Each member must appear in the table only once.
3. If two members share the same birth year they should be ordered alphabetically by last name.
4. The page must run using the built in php server via ``php -S localhost:8888``.
5. All properties in the dataset must be accounted for in the final table.


##Additional

- You are free to choose between a server-side or client-side implementation.
- You may use whichever client-side libraries and build tools you feel appropriate.
- Feel free to make the table as aesthetically pleasing as you wish. (Bonus points for a responsive solution)
